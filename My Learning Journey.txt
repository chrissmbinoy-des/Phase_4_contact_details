My Learning Journey
-------------------

As an ISC student, The only programming language known to me was Java.
I have learnt a lot from each phase , with the help of youtube and python official websites.

The greatest challenge that i have to face was to learn numerous Jsom file functions.
The functions like json.load , json.dump etc was hard to memorize.
So I had to link these keywords with their actual functions in my memory, which took much time to organize

I would be continuing to learn python from now on......
